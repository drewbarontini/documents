**Haml**

- Putting `-#` (Ruby comment) and nesting inside of it will comment out an entire block of Haml without having to comment out each line individually.

**Ruby & Ruby on Rails**

- In the console, you can type `_` as the previous command (e.g. `user = _` setting `user` to the previous command you just ran).

**Terminal/iTerm on OS X**

- `CTRL+R` does a reverse search on the previous commands you've entered.
- Command-clicking on an `http://` link will open that link in your default browser.
