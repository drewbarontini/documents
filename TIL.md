Today I Learned
===============

**General**

- If you use `rsync` for deployment, and you're repeatedly asked to enter your password, you have to paste your public key into `.ssh/authorized_keys` on your server.

**jQuery**

- If you are using nested objects and `$.extend()`, pass `true` as the first parameter to make a recursive copy.

**Haml**

- Putting `-#` (Ruby comment) and nesting inside of it will comment out an entire block of Haml without having to comment out each line individually.

**OS X**

- `Command+Option+H` hides all windows but the currently focused one.

**Ruby & Ruby on Rails**

- In the console, you can type `_` as the previous command (e.g. `user = _` setting `user` to the previous command you just ran).
- In Haml, to add punctuation after a `link_to`, do `= link_to('Text', '#') + '.'`.

**Terminal/iTerm on OS X**

- `CTRL+R` does a reverse search on the previous commands you've entered.
- Command-clicking on an `http://` link will open that link in your default browser.
