# Daily Planning

Since we now have the week outlined and set up because of our [Weekly Planning](https://github.com/drewbarontini/documents/blob/master/workflow/weekly-planning.md), we can look at planning the current day.

## Organize Tasks

I first look at the tasks I have for the day, and I make sure they:

- Have a priority level assigned
- Have a time level assigned

I also set **three absolutes**: the tasks that I have to get done if I get nothing else done.

## Daily Log

Along the way, I keep a `Daily Log` note file to just jot down miscellaneous notes and comments about what I'm doing. That way, I have a place to refer back to how my day was altered or affected. This is vital to improving the efficiency and planning of your day.

## Routine

I have a `Morning Routine` note file that I look at _every_ morning as I go through the same process. This helps me to stick to my planning, and sets up each day for success.
