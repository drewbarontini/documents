# Planning

Every Friday, I plan out the next week to have:

- My calendar organized and all events scheduled and accounted for
- My **Weekly Milestones** set and reviewed (will cover in more detail later)
- My task list organized and prioritized (with _Weekly Milestones_ scheduled)
- My **Focus** set (will cover in more detail later)

**Note**: I do this _exact_ same process for both my professional life and my personal life. I think that is vital to making sure that work isn't superceding life.

_On the management side of things, I also have to look at team planning, but, as that's an aside to my personal organization, it's not mentioned in detail here._

## Calendar

Look at next week's scheduled events:

- How does my schedule look?
- How many meetings are scheduled?
- How many hours can I "block off" for work?

### Blocking off time for work tasks

If you have meetings to go alongside your expected weekly tasks, I recommend "blocking off" time for work in the calendar. I look at the calendar and fill the open time (during work hours) with "Work" events (marked as _Private_ to just show me as busy). If there is more open time than I need, I leave those open, and I try and schedule pairing time, or look at what future tasks I can get started on then.

_Yes, unexpected events come up, but setting this time helps in achieving my tasks, and I'm able to point to which events did prevent me from completing my tasks._

I also block off time for any breaks I might need, lunch time, and any personal errand(s) I have to run during work hours.

### Themes & Focus

Something that I learned from [Mike Vardy](https://twitter.com/mikevardy) — and slightly modified — is to create _Themes_, as well as a monthly (or weekly, in my case) _Focus_.

For example, the _Themes_ that I use are:

- **Administration**: Project management, document setup, system review, etc.
- **Execution**: Work on primary _Focus_.
- **Progress**: Team check-ins,, feedback, code reviews, pairing planning, keep up with tech etc.
- **Planning**: Weekly (and quarterly) planning.

And this is how that fits into my schedule Monday-Friday:

- **Monday**: _Administration_
- **Tuesday**: _Execution_
- **Wednesday**: _Progress_
- **Thursday**: _Execution_
- **Friday**: _Planning_

With these _Themes_ in place — which I actually add as calendar events (`Administration (T)`) — I'm able to determine _which_ tasks should be completed _when_. Oh, and remember how we blocked off the work time? Well, now we do know the actual _when_.

In addition to the themes, I also have a _Focus_. I set this week to week, but it also can extend into a longer timeframe. For example, right now I'm working on a project related to "Onboarding," so that is my current _Focus_. When I plan for next week, I will create an event (`Onboarding (F)`) that extends Monday-Friday. Now when I review my schedule for the day in the morning, I'm able to see which _Theme_ lines up with the _Focus_. For example, on Monday I'll do _Administrative_ tasks related to _Onboarding_ primarily.
