This one is kind of obvious, but just set it up this way. You don't want to get notifications for everything or nothing. You aren't a Sith Lord.

If you're working around other people, or screencasting, this is a good one to uncheck for privacy reasons.

The red dot is useless. You just want the number. Don't do it. Just don't.

Pretty self-explanatory. I add some additional words that I want to be notified when they are said. You can also do this to keep track of projects you're interested in.

I recommend setting these to your actual _Do Not Disturb_ time.

## Sidebar Theme

These settings are found under `Preferences > Sidebar Theme`.

This is just a reminder that you can update the sidebar theme. There is also [slackthemes.net](http://slackthemes.net) for additional themes you can download and use.

## Mark as Read

These settings are found under `Preferences > Mark as Read`.

☝️ These are very useful shortcuts for dealing with a lot of unreads.

## Advanced Options

These settings are found under `Preferences > Advanced Options`.

I can't recommend this one highly enough. Your sidebar will get crazy with channels and DMs, so turning this on will keep it focused and less busy.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can always bring up the keyboard shortcuts window in Slack by hitting `command+/` (`control` in Windows). I'm just going to highlight the ones I use most frequently, and some tips associated with them.

- `escape`: Mark as read
- `shift+escape`: Mark all as read
- `command+k` (or `command+t`): Quick switcher
- `up_arrow` in text box: Edit last message
- `command+shift+\`: React to last message
- `command+,`: Open preferences (protip: use this in nearly all applications)

### Quick Switcher

This is my most-used keyboard shortcut. I use it to bring up channels and Direct Messages. It is intelligent, so when you have an unread channel or DM, it will show at the top. When I need to view all my unreads, I hit `command+k` and `enter`, and I'll continue to do that through the unread channels and DMs. DMs will come up before channels. If you want to quickly jump to a DM, type the first letter of the person's first and last name. For example, `db` should show names like `Drew Barontini`, sorted alphabetically.
